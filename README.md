# fullstack-review

An application that utilizes the MERN stack to grab the top 20 github profiles.
This application has the ability to store and grab data from MongoDB to show a user's searched/added github profiles.

This project familiarized myself with incorporating the backend to the frontend to make a fullstack application.

This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com). This project was worked on with a pair.
